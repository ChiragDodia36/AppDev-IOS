About the Hw1:

i. The parts of Homework 01 I have completed:

I've finished implementing the LearnerCardModel class, which now stores a list of questions along with their corresponding answers. I added logic to safely iterate through the questions, ensuring that the app doesn't crash when it reaches the end of the list. Additionally, I instantiated this model in the ViewController.swift file and connected it to the UI using the provided @IBOutlet and @IBAction methods. I also addressed the TODO items in the code, specifically clearing the answer label whenever a new question is displayed.

ii. Any interesting parts I may have added:

To boost interactivity, I incorporated five extra questions and answers into the model. Additionally, I implemented a user-friendly feature where the app prompts the user to display a question first if they try to view an answer before doing so. These updates improved the overall flow and usability of the application beyond the initial requirements.
